# Wacom driver recompiler for Ubuntu 18.04

Well, I'm really using Kubuntu 18.04 at the moment.
That machine will be switched to Manjaro when I have the time
(among other benefits of Manjaro, the tablet "just works" there)

## Usage

- download the two drivers from here:

https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom/releases

https://github.com/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom/releases

- run `./install.sh`

## Why have this?

Whenever Ubuntu gets kernel updates,
the driver needs to be recompiled with the current kernel to work.

Ideally I would create a PPA with this...
